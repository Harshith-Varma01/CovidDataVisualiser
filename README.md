# CovidDataVisualiser
Uses python and data visualisation libraries to represent covid data visually. 

Using Python and certain graphing libraries, this project aims to visually represent the number of cases and deaths related to Covid-19 in any given country at a given point in time.

This data is represented in the form of:
1) A table
2) A donut chart
3) A bar graph
4) A chloropleth map of India

I made use of the following libraries and packages to write this code:
1) Pandas
2) Matplotlib
3) Seaborn
4) GeoPandas
5) Requests
6) PrettyTable
7) BeautifulSoup

This can be packaged into a standalone exectuable, or integrated into another, larger covid dashboard that displays the data in a web/mobile application with a GUI.
